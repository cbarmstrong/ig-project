Data Explanation
Weights
Weights data is indicative, as values have been rounded up or down to two
decimal points. Where very small values are concerned, which would display as

ICB Supersector Code and Supersector Descriptions
Information on the Industrial Classification Benchmark (ICB) is available from
www.icbenchmark.com.
Timing of data
Constituents & Weights spreadsheets are generally published in arrears and
contain the data as at the most recent review data. However, some spreadsheets
are updated on a more frequent basis. Please refer to the data date that is shown
in the spreadsheet. Please see the index rules on www.ftse.com for further
